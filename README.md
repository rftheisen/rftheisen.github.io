# Bob's Learning Projects

This is where I host software projects and games to experiment and learn with. 

## PongLab
Check out my Web-based game inspired by pong called PongLab, designed to inspire curiosity. Players can see what code is executing as they play.
Play here: [rtheisen.github.io/pages](https://rftheisen.github.io/pong/)
